INTRODUCTION
==================================================================
In computing, the Nechung Oracle Mutator is a "super-mutator" that can be 
setup to receive all Limelight Networks Agile Cloud mutator callsbacks for 
a given storage path (or all paths, recursively) into the hands of the 
Nechung mutator service, where it is running.   This effectively allows all 
decision making and workflow control happen at the mutator, requiring less 
advanced configuration in the Agile Cloud.

This project includes examples that enable Agile to process assets in a 
variety of ways, off-network, on-network (on Limelight computing 
infrastructure inside the Limelight Network) in a simple way.  The goal of 
the application/service is to provide a simple framework with a 
"super-mutator" and lots of little simple to write regular "mutators".

In non-computing terms, the Nechung Oracle is the State Oracle of Tibet. 
The medium of the State Oracle currently resides with the current Dalai 
Lama in Dharamsala, India. Prior to the Himalayan diaspora resulting from 
the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Nechung 
Oracle was the designated head of the Nechung monastery in Tibet.  

The Agile Cloud is a platform, built on a foundation affectionately known 
as "LAMA", the Limelight Asset Management Architecture.  There is no
affilliation, affection, or lack thereof, to Tibet, the Dalai Lama, or
the Chinese Cultural Revolution.  It is just a play on perceived theme.

Workflow examples
=================================================================

nechung.downloader
------------------
This simple example will automatically download the asset to the
machine running the mutator.

nechung.indexhtml
-----------------
In combination with AgileCLU, this mutator will build an index of
all files in a directory, and write a corresponding HTML5 index
called "index.html".

nechung.iphonetvembed
---------------------
If you make a directory in Agile called "make.iphonetv.embed.html" 
with one line of content in it (that specifies the path of a 
MediaTranscode output), e.g. "/TV/Video/Storage Wars Unlocked Sell High",
it will automatically build an index file called "Storage Wars Unlocked
Sell High.html" that plays the best format for the device -- higher
resolution for more capable devices.

nechung.mail
------------
This simple example will automatically e-mail an address with the
URL for an asset.

nechung.mediainfo
-----------------

nechung.mp3m3u
--------------
This simple mutator will use AgileCLU to index a directory and look
for any MP3s and build a corresponding M3U playlist.

nechung.prowl
-------------

Using prowlapp.com, automatically notify iOS devices of an event.

nechung.qtfaststart
-------------------
This simple mutator will use Daniel Taylor's qtfaststart application
to automatically reposition video atom for fast pseudo-streaming.
It requires that https://github.com/danielgtaylor/qtfaststart is 
installed.

nechung.video2ios
-----------------

nechung.videoembed
------------------

nechung.videohtml
-----------------
